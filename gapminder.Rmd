```{r, echo = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/MJ/Downloads/data")
gapminder <- read.delim("gapminderDataFiveYear.txt")
gapminder.UG <- subset(gapminder, country == "Uganda")
gapminder.UK <- subset(gapminder, country == "United Kingdom")
gapminder.US <- subset(gapminder, country == "United States")
plot(gdpPercap~year, data = gapminder.UG, main = "Uganda")
plot(gdpPercap~year, data = gapminder.UK, main = "United Kingdom")
plot(gdpPercap~year, data = gapminder.US, main = "United States")
```

Not only is the GDP per capita much lower across time in Uganda as compared to the United States or the United Kingdom, but Uganda's GDP per capita experiences a decrease in the 1970s until the 1990s, as compared to steady growth in the other two countries.
